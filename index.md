I am a PhD candidate in [Economics at USI Lugano](https://idep.usi.ch/), working under the supervision of [Patricia Funk](https://sites.google.com/site/patriciafelicitasfunk/patricia-funks-research-webpage) and [Lorenz KÃ¼ng](https://lorenzkueng.droppages.com/). 

__I am on the academic job market 2024/25.__

My research focuses broadly on gender equality in two domains: among scholars in the field of Economics, and on the labour market. As an applied economist, I combine elements from the standard economists' toolkit such as econometric methods and quantitative modelling with less conventional tools like web-scraping for data collection or basic machine learning methods for text analysis.

My research interests include __Labour__, __Gender__ and __Household Economics__ and __Economics of Science__.
